# User story #5: 
When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a heading element (H1 size), a sub heading element (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.

# Rules for lists
> number of whitespaces before hyphen character "-"
0 ou 1 => level 1:    |-aweawe    ou |  -aweae 
2 ou 3 => level 2:    |  -aweawe    ou |   -aweae  
4 ou more => level 3: |    -aweawe    ou |           -aweae   
Whitespaces after the hyphen character doesn't matter
You can choose any level of indentation at anytime
